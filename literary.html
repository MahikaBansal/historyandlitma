                <p>The title, “I Wandered Lonely as a Cloud” suggests that this poem is about feeling alone or lost,
                    like a solitary cloud floating in the sky. The title gives the reader the feeling of loneliness or
                    wonder, explaining the emotions that nature inspires in people. The title sets up the central idea
                    of the poem, that nature doesn’t just describe the outside world but rather it transforms how we
                    feel and understand ourselves. </p>

                <p>The speaker begins by describing himself wandering around feeling lonely, like a single cloud
                    drifting over vast hills and valleys. His mood suddenly shifts when he sees almost one-thousand
                    golden daffodils dancing and fluttering in the breeze beside a lake. The flowers seem endless and
                    sparkle so brightly that they outshine the waves beside them. This sight fills the speaker with
                    happiness and amazement. When he later arrives home, he is reminded of the beautiful daffodils and
                    feels happy and peaceful once again. This vision of nature brings him comfort, even when he isn’t
                    physically present to observe it. </p>

                    1. “Lonely as a cloud” (simile): This phrase is repeated in the title and in the first line of the
                    poem. It draws a relationship between the speaker and the cloud, explaining that the speaker is
                    lonely and in solitude, much like a cloud. This explains to the reader the speaker’s state of mind
                    at the beginning of the poem, setting up the main shift in the poem – from sadness to happiness.
                </p>

                <p>
                    2. “They [daffodils] stretched in never-ending line” (imagery): This image helps the reader picture
                    the vast abundance of the daffodils, creating an image of the grandeur of the daffodils in the
                    reader’s mind.
                </p>

                <p>
                    3. “Tossing their [daffodils] heads sprightly dance.” (personification): This statement makes the
                    daffodil’s presence alive and beautiful because of their ability to steal the speaker’s attention
                    through their spirited dance. This is important because the role that the daffodils play in this
                    poem is a direct contrast to gloomy clouds, and by portraying them as confident, the reader can
                    understand the abrupt change in mood of the speaker.
                </p>

                <p>
                    4. “The waves beside them [daffodils] danced; but they [daffodils] / Out-did the sparkling waves in
                    glee:” (personification): This adds to the reader’s perceived idea of the personality of the
                    daffodils. Subconsciously, we view waves as dazzling and grand, and since the daffodils are
                    outshining those waves, the reader can understand the sheer scale of the impact they had on the
                    speaker.
                </p>

                <p>
                    5. Rhyming: The final word of the last two lines of every stanza rhymes, giving each stanza a clean
                    ending before transitioning into the next, creating a steady rhythm while reading. A prominent theme
                    in the poem is tranquility, and having a smooth reading experience adds to that feeling.

            <div class="dropdown-content" id="attitude">
                <p>The tone of the poem starts as lonely and absent, with the speaker describing his state of mind as
                    floating over hills and valleys. However, after the speaker sees the daffodils, the tone of the poem
                    quickly becomes joyful and amazed, showing his appreciation for the beauty of nature. The tone of
                    the poem tells a story; it shows how the speaker can pull himself out of sorrow by the happy
                    memories of nature. </p>

            <div class="dropdown-content" id="shifts">
                <p>The main shift in this poem is the change of the speaker’s mood from loneliness to joy. In the
                    beginning, the speaker is “lonely as a cloud”, but after seeing the daffodils, his mood transforms
                    to happiness and delight. </p>

            <button class="dropdown-btn" onclick="toggleDropdown('title2')">Title</button>
            <div class="dropdown-content" id="title2">
                <p>While my initial interpretation of the title remains correct, there is so much more to the poem
                    than just loneliness. The poem begins with that loneliness, but later shifts to happiness and joy,
                    which is reflected by the use of the past tense in the title, showing how the speaker no longer
                    feels lonely. </p>

                <p>
                    William Wordsworth’s “I Wandered Lonely as a Cloud” is an iconic poem of the Romantic era, exploring
                    the emotional depth and relationship between nature and how it shapes people’s outlooks on life.
                    This poem was inspired by a real experience on April 15th, 1802, when Wordsworth and his sister
                    Dorothy came across a “long belt” of daffodils in the Lake District (British Library). This moment
                    deeply moved him and helped sparked the creation of this poem. Wordsworth’s poem explores his
                    emotions, ranging from loneliness to happiness, and describes how a simple encounter with nature can
                    have a profound psychological impact.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The poem opens with a simile, comparing the speaker’s state of mind to a cloud drifting solemnly
                    above the landscape. This establishes an emotional detachment and physical separation from reality,
                    making the reader feel the same sense of melancholy that the speaker feels. However, this emotion
                    quickly switches when he encounters a vast group of beautiful golden daffodils stretching out for
                    what seems like miles beside the lake. The contrast between the emotional detachment of a cloud and
                    the dancing beauty of daffodils illustrates how a simple moment can completely alter someone’s
                    worldview. This is important because it captures Wordsworth’s central belief that nature can awaken
                    emotions in people who feel lonely or numb.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Wordsworth describes daffodils not as flowers, but as individual joyous souls with an almost
                    human-like presence. The daffodils are described as “dancing and tossing their heads,” giving them a
                    confident and carefree personality. By comparing the daffodils to stars, “continuous as the stars
                    that shine,” the speaker suggests that the daffodils possess a celestial quality, thereby elevating
                    the reader's perception of them into something more otherworldly and awe-inspiring. This goes hand
                    in hand with the impact that the flowers have; the mere sight of these flowers is enough to draw the
                    speaker out of his sorrow.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The most prevalent element of this poem is the shift in tone from loneliness to joy. The last stanza
                    of this poem most effectively demonstrates this shift: “In a vacant or pensive mood, / They flash
                    upon that inward eye / And then my heart with pleasure fills, / And dances with the daffodils.” The
                    speaker is recounting his emotions after observing the flowers. He sits vacantly at home, feeling
                    like a lonely cloud, until he remembers the memory of the dancing flowers, and then his heart fills
                    with pleasure and joy. This moment illustrates Wordsworth’s belief that nature can have a profound
                    impact on a person's mood. It also reinforces the idea that poetry comes from revisiting simple
                    personal experiences rather than grand events.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The poem’s rhythm also reinforces its themes. The poem follows a gentle rhyming pattern, creating a
                    smooth reading flow that evokes feelings of tranquility and calm within the reader. By knowing what
                    to expect in the following line, reading the poem relaxes the reader, similarly to how the sight of
                    the daffodils relaxed the speaker. Wordsworth believed that nature has the power to heal, and by
                    providing the same feelings in the reader, Wordsworth was able to communicate the experiences of the
                    speaker effectively.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Ultimately, “I Wandered Lonely as a Cloud” is both a celebration of the beauty of nature and an
                    exploration of its vast emotional and physical impacts. Wordsworth suggests that even small moments
                    can have profound impacts in moments of sadness or detachment. By using vivid imagery and flowing
                    language, this poem aligns nature with a sense of joy and spirituality, describing it as a living,
                    breathing soul rather than just a backdrop.
