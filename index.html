            <h2>Historical Analysis</h2>
            <p>
                William Wordsworth's poem, "I Wandered Lonely as a Cloud," is a quiet reflection of nature that was
                written between 1804 - 1807, and was first published in 1807 in the book Poems in Two Volumes
                (Wordsworth 418), several years after the end of the French Revolution and the start of British
                Romanticism in 1798. The poem is short, which was considered a revolutionary new style as part of
                British Romanticism. It also embodies the British Romanticism themes of memory, imagination, nature, and
                emotion.

            <p>
                Many consider Wordsworth’s Lyrical Ballads, published in 1798, to be the literary start of British
                Romanticism, which consisted mainly of poems (and lasted until 1837). Romanticism started as the French
                Revolution of 1789-1799 (which began in 1789 with the Fall of Bastille) was ending, and after Louis XIV
                and Marie Antoinette were killed in 1793. It also began while the French Revolution ended with
                Napoleon’s coup d’etat in 1799. The Industrial Revolution was also occurring at this time, and
                influenced Wordsworth’s writing.

                Wordsworth first traveled from Britain to France in 1790, at age 20, arriving during the Revolution’s
                hopeful, idealistic phase, and he initially supported the French Revolution. During this period, he was
                immediately drawn to the Enlightenment ideals of liberty, equality, and the challenge to centuries of
                monarchy.

                However, he became disillusioned by the violence that the French Revolution created, and particularly by
                the Reign of Terror in 1793-94, which influenced the development of his Romanticism style as a response.
                By the time he wrote “I Wandered Lonely as a Cloud,” Europe was again in turmoil under Napoleon, and
                Wordsworth’s seem to often turn to nature for comfort.
            </p>

            <p>
                Wordsworth became a central figure in defining Romanticism, especially through devoting his poems to
                ordinary subjects, his connection to nature, and his personal emotional experience. “I Wandered Lonely
                as a Cloud” embodies these principles by focusing not on political events but on a day to day encounter
                with nature, and the effect of his memory of nature on his mood.
            </p>

            <hr>

            <p>
                Personally, Wordsworth had essentially lost his parents and sister by age thirteen, but wrote this poem
                after marrying Mary Hutchinson and having two kids. This poem has a much lighter and happier tone than
                some of his earlier poems. Mary actually wrote two lines of the poem (lines 15-16). (Wordsworth 418).
                Wordsworth was a member of the bourgeoisie, or the middle class, and liked to write about everyday
                moments, which was also a revolutionary element of Romanticism.
            </p>

            <hr>

            <p>
                 When this poem in particular was first published, it was critically panned. Early critics dismissed the
                idea of writing about such simple everyday moments in life. The book Poems in Two Volumes was published
                to bad reviews overall and Wordsworth revised it in 1815 for a later published version, with some
                footnotes defending why he wrote the poem the way he did (Wordsworth 418-419). One other Wordsworth poem
                in Poems in Two Volumes, named “Ode, Intimations of Immortality,” had particularly bad reviews because
                critics felt that he assumed the idea of pre-existence in a former state (Wordsworth 432), which did not
                align with Christianity, and that may have affected the reviews for all of the poems in the book.

            </p>
            <hr>
            <p>
                However, as Romanticism gained popularity in European culture, this poem became one of Wordsworth’s most
                beloved and influential works. It helped solidify the key British Romantic values of emotion and the
                spiritual power of nature. It went on to inspire generations of poets to value ordinary life and the
                beauty of the natural world instead of the more traditional serious topics historically addressed in
                poetry.
