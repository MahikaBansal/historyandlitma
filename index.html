            <h2>Historical Analysis</h2>
            <p>
                William Wordsworth's poem "I Wandered Lonely as a Cloud" was written in 1804 and first published in
                1807,
                during a period of significant political and cultural upheaval in Europe. Although the poem itself is a
                quiet
                reflection of nature, it emerged during the late 18th and early 19th centuries, which were drastically
                shaped
                by the chaos of the French Revolution and the rise of Romanticism.
            </p>

            <hr>

            <p>
                In 1787, he entered college, and it was during those coming-of-age years that the
                French Revolution,
                one of the most influential transformations in European history, occurred in 1789.
            </p>

            <p>
                Wordsworth first traveled to France on a walking tour in 1790, arriving during
                the Revolution’s hopeful,
                idealistic phase. During this period, he was immediately drawn to the Revolution’s Enlightenment ideals
                of liberty,
                equality, and the challenge to centuries of monarchy. This blend of political excitement and the natural
                landscapes
                of France and the Alps had a significant influence on his poetry and political beliefs.
            </p>

            <p>
                However, as the Revolution descended into violence during the Reign of Terror,
                Wordsworth became deeply
                disillusioned with revolutionary ideals. The Reign of Terror was backed by the working poor against
                aristocratic
                counterrevolutionaries, which offended Wordsworth’s middle-class ideals and need for reform. He found
                the ensuing
                violence and extremism shocking and ultimately viewed the Revolution as a move from “respectable”
                beginnings to
                “wickedness.”
            </p>

            <p>
                In his <em>Letter to the Bishop of Llandaff</em>, he objects to the violence and bloodshed of the French
                Revolution, writing:
                “They [thinking and feeling men] are sorry that the prejudice and weakness of mankind have made it
                necessary to force
                an individual into an unnatural situation, which requires more than human talents and human virtues.”
                This passage shows Wordsworth’s disillusionment with the Revolution’s extremism and his concern for
                individuals trapped
                by circumstances beyond their control. This collapse of his hopes turned him away from politics and into
                themes of memory,
                imagination, and emotion. Nature became a form of refuge for Wordsworth.
            </p>

            <hr>

            <p>
                By the time he wrote “I Wandered Lonely as a Cloud,” Europe was again in turmoil under Napoleon, and
                Wordsworth’s belief
                in nature became his escape to heal and stabilize.
            </p>

            <hr>

            <p>
                This historical period also marked the rise of Romanticism, which rejected Enlightenment rationalism and
                emphasized
                emotion, imagination, and the natural world. As Wordsworth rejected the French Revolution, he also
                rejected Enlightenment
                ideals and instead embraced Romantic ideals, becoming a central figure in defining
                Romanticism—especially through his
                devotion to ordinary subjects, his connection to nature, and his personal emotional experience.
            </p>

            <p>
                “I Wandered Lonely as a Cloud” embodies these principles by focusing not on political events but on the
                personal encounter
                between the writer and the natural world.
            </p>

            <hr>

            <p>
                When Wordsworth’s collection <em>Poems, in Two Volumes</em>
                (1807), which included
                “I Wandered Lonely as a Cloud,” was first published, it was met with harsh criticism. The most
                influential critic of the
                Romantic era was Francis Jeffery, who used the <em>Edinburgh Review</em> to attack Wordsworth’s poetic
                language.
            </p>

            <p>
                In 1807, Jeffery directly targeted Wordsworth, opening his review with: “If the printing of such trash
                as this be not
                felt as an insult on the public taste, we are afraid it cannot be insulted” (<em>The Critical Reception
                    1807–1818</em>).
                Jeffery’s main complaint was that Wordsworth wrote “upon principle and system,” arguing that
                Wordsworth’s attempt to use
                ordinary subjects and language resulted not in authenticity, but in forced simplicity.
            </p>

            <p>
                This early reception positioned Wordsworth as a controversial figure. Yet, at the same time, others
                began to recognize the
                originality and emotional depth of his work. Ironically, the Romantic qualities—simplicity, emotional
                sincerity, and the
                spiritual power of nature—that Jeffery condemned would later become core Romantic values, inspiring
                generations of poets
                to value ordinary life and the beauty of the natural world.
